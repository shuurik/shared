Since most of the plugs are USB it did not fall out of the socket in the Airbnb\u2019s that we stayed, since it wasn\u2019t being weighed down by multiple heavy plugs. We bought this version over models only with USB and USB-C because we needed the higher power output that the traditional plug provided to power our MacBook Pro.

So at least I wasn't trapped in without any adapter conversion. They do not do any 220 to 110 conversion, but they had all 110v outlets in my hotel. Anyways, my phone charger is also auto sensing / converting from 220 to 110 in the event that they only had 220v outlets. I am returning and not replacing this device.

I lifted up the converted and could smell a distinctive burned smell coming from the vents. I plugged only the converter back into the wall and nothing. I checked the outlet with a lamp and the outlet worked fine. Luckily, all of the electronics plugged into the convert were undamaged.

According to the advice to allow a 50% overhead in the rating, a 2000 W unit should have been adequate. However, I bought the 3000 W unit to have even more margin. It costs only $10 more, and is no larger in physical size (but it weighs a few pounds more) than the 2000 w unit. I inspected it closely and have used it for several days. I am very pleased with it. I have one very minor issue with the power cord that caused me to withhold the 5 star rating. See more below.", "Unlike some, ELC's description of the unit on Amazon is complete and the pictures are large and clear. I originally ordered a different transformer, but I canceled the order after I learned some of the details that were missing from its description and pictures. These missing details were provided sporadically in answers from customers and from the seller. ELC has their act together better, which enabled me to order with more confidence.", "The unit runs noiselessly, without any noticeable rise in temperature. It did have a slight odor when I unpacked it, but that disappeared once it was out of the box and had aired a bit. Keep in mind that I am using it at less than 1/2 of its rated output, and I use it only intermittently, for perhaps 10 minutes at a time. Your results may difer.", "The transformer itself is toroidal shaped, which is more efficient and reduces emission of electromagnetic field, compared to a traditional non-toroidal transformer. (It is more difficult to manufacture a toroidal transformer.)  The better efficiency contributes to the much lighter weight compared to many of the other transformers of the same rating that Amazon sells.", "Based upon electrical measurements, the unit appears to be wired as an \"auto-transformer\". The added efficiency of an auto-transformer can further contribute to a savings in weight. However, it means that the output is electrically connected to the input, not just inductively coupled through the core of the transformer. My measurements indicate that for the step-up mode in which I am operating, the neutral of the 120 V input appears to be at middle potential of the two power conductors of the 240 V output. That is not what is what is expected by foreign appliances, but is typical for a US 230 V circuit, in which both of the power conductors are not at ground potential (neither is neutral). Some have reported GFI issues using other transformers overseas, perhaps related to this feature. I am operating the unit on a GFI protected circuit and have had no issues with the GFI or my appliances. You results may vary, depending upon your appliances and house wiring.", "The unit appears to have a reasonably good quality of construction. All solder joints are covered by heat-shrink tubing, so they can't be closely inspected, but they look reasonable in size and shape of the solder joint.", "Almost all the fittings on the front and back, and the feet, are doubly secured in place by a generous applications of hot glue inside the case.", "I was drawn to this particular unit by the good ratings, and by the power cord, which appears in the picture to be, and is described as, heavy duty. It appears to be heavier than those on many of the other transformers offered by Amazon. Now that I have it in hand, I see that it is a 3 conductor, 14 AWG cable, which is moderately heavy. The NEC rates such cable for 15 Amps continuous service. For this transformer operating in the step-up mode, 15 A corresponds to a load of 1800 W or less. At an output of 3000 W, the current in that cable would be 25 amps or higher. (Actually, the rating is more accurately stated on the back of the unit as 3000 VA, not W, which puts the maximum current at 25 A.) That amount of current might also exceed what can be provided by a typical 120 V house circuit breaker and wiring. Even with the recommended 1.5 factor for a safety margin, the current would be more than 15 A in the step-up mode. The power cable is undersized for step-up operation.", "On the other hand, if you're operating in the step-down mode, the cable is adequate to provide more than 3000 VA.", "If you're considering using the the 5000 W (VA, really) largest unit offered by ELC, then I suggest that you first contact the seller to learn the size of its power cable. It appears in the pictures to be the same as for the 3000 w unit which would make it further underrated for the set-up mode, and marginal for the step-down mode.", "I am using my 3000 w unit at 1300 W, which would correspond to a current of 11 to 12 A, so the cable rating is not an issue to me. However, I have withheld the 5 star rating because I feel the supplier should either provide a heavier cable with the unit, or provide a warning about using it for continuous loads above 15 A.", "In summary, the ELC unit seems to be an excellent device. However, if you are using it at high loads without margins you may find that you have concerns related to the power cable rating or house wiring adequacy. The neutral wiring arrangement of the auto-transformer may cause difficulties in some unusual situations.", "Engineer here.  I really like this for a couple of reasons.  The packaging is good.  Arrived safely with no damage despite the weight.  It's a good size for anywhere that uses the 13 amp UK fused type of plug because you're not going to get much more than 3,000 watts out of one of those anyway.  The construction is solid and it has a nice fit / finish to it.", "It comes with a US style plug which is not ideal for my situation.  We're in the UAE and I need to step down to 120 VAC.  I didn't want to use an adapter to plug this into the wall, but I was able to find the local style plug with screw terminals for like 7 AED ($2) at a local supermarket.  Lop the USA style plug off and slap that bad boy on and you are good to go.", "It makes ZERO noise and you still have a universal 220V outlet that out can plug anything with a switching power supply into.", "EDIT: I had to knock off two star's on this one.  I've had two of these units where the 120V outlet on the front failed.  It looks like the contacts get hot and work their way out the back of the socket and then it no longer makes contact.  My wife uses them for her hair dryer so I expect that's a factor.  But still, the hairdryer is less than the rated load.", "The good news is, it's not too difficult to repair.  I fixed one using the cut off end of an extension cord, some hot glue, and wire nuts.  The other one I upgraded using a cooper wiring dual 120V outlet + 2 USB charging ports.  Used a dremel to cut the profile out of the sheet metal.  It's a snug fit, but a really nice upgrade.", "I own several vintage espresso machines that require 220v lines. Okay, I collect them. I owned a typical 1500w step-up converter for many years but recently brought back an espresso machine from Ye Olde Countree that draws just about 1500w, so I bought another typical transformer 3000w step-up converter. Most of these things are built in China at low cost, and I suspect many are from the same manufacturer with different names on the cases.", "I bought one with a USB power point on the front based on the premise that it might be newer than some of the others. The transformer was what I expected, but its smell surpassed what I expected. All of these transformers will emit some type of smell for a period owing to the materials employed.", "I took the transformer outside and opened the case to allow it to air out for a few days, hopefully to let most of the smell dissipate. Inside I discovered a ground wire from the transformer that had part of its sheath exposed. When I moved the wire, it came loose from its connection. I fixed it but realized that the smell was not going away quickly enough. The seller's response to a photo and text query was to return it to Amazon. I hoped for a bit more concern, but that is how things go nowadays.", "I wanted to avoid getting another typical transformer and stumbled across the ELC T-3000. What attracts me is the toroidal transformer. As noted elsewhere, toroidal transformers emit less of an inductive field, but more important, they take a little more effort to manufacture. Perhaps that would equal a slightly higher quality product.", "This transformer surpasses all the others I have owned. The case is two-thirds the height of my 1500w one and weighs perhaps two-thirds less despite handling twice the wattage. My 1500w transformer is quiet, but the T-3000 is nearly silent. The T-3000 emits some smell, but it is a fraction of what the other transformers produce.", "The T-3000 has the same two outlets on the front as any similar transformer. The circuit breaker is on the back rather than the front on my other transformer, something that I am beginning to like aesthetically. It fits into the kitchen decor less badly. The main power cable is by far the thickest of any transformer I have used. I do not think it is necessary, but I like the attempt at quality.", "There are no documents, but once you see the back things become clear. Use the red switch to choose input voltage and that is all. There are what I assume are reset buttons on the back, but they are overkill if there is already a circuit breaker. Nice safety feature.", "I was surprised that the T-3000 cost significantly less than the old-style transformer it replaced.

I  was using my phone in bed when I heard a snapping sound, and saw a pretty blue flash to the left of my head eventually followed by the smell of an electrical short. Thank God that I was awake to hear the short and unplug the device. I don't think it would have went any further than the initial spark due to fact that the device immediately died and the blue status light went out . The device of course shorted out, but luckily it didn't short out my phone. As a happenstance, I also purchased: \"Ceptics CT-9C USA to Most of Europe Travel Adapter Plug - Type C (3 Pack)\" for my wife's hair dryer and iron (because they are over 200W). So at least I wasn't trapped in without any adapter conversion. They do not do any 220 to 110 conversion, but they had all 110v outlets in my hotel. Anyways, my phone charger is also auto sensing / converting from 220 to 110 in the event that they only had 220v outlets. I am returning and not replacing this device. I will keep and use the Ceptics converters in the event that I ever go to Europe again.", "The convert worked well for one day but quickly exploded with a loud bang. I was charging two phones (well under the 200W limit), one through the AC plugs and the other through the USB. When I unplugged both devices, there was a loud bang. I thought something had fallen off a shelf. I looked around and noticed a burning smell and quickly unplugged everything. I lifted up the converted and could smell a distinctive burned smell coming from the vents. I plugged only the converter back into the wall and nothing. I checked the outlet with a lamp and the outlet worked fine. Luckily, all of the electronics plugged into the convert were undamaged.

I bought several of these and I actually use one as an everyday step-down converter for a TV and home theater I bought from USA where the voltage and my products are rated at 110-120V (in my country the national grid is 240V). There is a small switch which you set to your mains voltage - [An aside here: the values on this switch are 115V and 230V, but almost all appliances will work fine within a certain range, ie 110-120V and 220 to 240V]. The converter upconverts the incoming 110-120V to 220-240V output, or downconverts 220-240V to 110-120V by doing a simple 2-to-1 or 1-to-2. There is no conversion for the current (amps), only for the voltage.", "I sometimes hear a low buzzing noise from the converter when it has been running for several hours. I initially thought it was that particular unit, so i switched it, but the new one also had the same issue. But anyway even after a few months of this there doesn't seem to be any bad effects from the buzzing noise, and there's no overheating at all, so it's still 5 stars. And that acts as an alert that I've been watching TV too long! Some have complained that they received busted units, but all the 3 500W units I ordered in Oct.2014 were perfectly fine and intact.", "Others have said, and Litefuze themselves also advise this, but it bears repeating. If you plan on using it for more than an hour or so at a time, buy a converter that's at least double the wattage of the combined gadgets you'll be connecting to the converter. So in my case the stuff I'm connecting to the converter are: a TV rated at 142W, a Vizio soundbar rated about 10W, and my home theater at 12W. The math comes to 142+10+12=164W, so I needed one that's at least 164 x 2 = 328W. The closest to this is the 500W converter- it doesn't hurt to have the extra capacity.", "A few niggles:", "- I dont like the buzzing sound after several hours of use, but it's not loud and doesnt seem to have any more ill effects.", "- More serious, I wish the small switch to change the voltage was better hidden or more difficult to access. I have it set to '230V', so it converts my 240V to 120V. But if a bumbling someone were to accidentally change it to the '115V' setting (which is easy to do with the easily accessible switch), then I think what would happen is the 1-to-2 upconversion. So my actual 240V would be output as 480V, frying my electronics almost instantly! [Again, this is just my opinion based on my understanding of how the thing works and I'm no electrician. If this is wrong someone please comment on this post and correct me - I'll alter it immediately].", "- The unit itself is quite heavy, about 300-500grams (half a kg). So take that into consideration if you are planning to use it for travel. I dont, so the weight isn't an issue for me.", "Overall though, these negatives are still minor enough for it to earn a full 5 stars.

I don't see how US regulations allow the company to do this, because as LiteFuze says in the supplied instruction leaflet, the unit will only provide 150 W continuously.", "I'm an electrical engineer and I work for an electric utility, so I'm familiar with transformer nameplate ratings for various types of transformers, including distribution transformers and substation transformers.  Every transformer that an electric utility buys has a power rating on its nameplate, and that value is always the CONTINUOUS power rating of the transformer.", "The manufacturer should say that this transformer has a power rating of 150 W; not \"300 W\".", "After trying and returning other voltage CONVERTERS, I bought this one because it is an actual TRANSFORMER.  For travel it is a bit heavy and large compared to the others but still not bad.  That's probably because it has an actual transformer inside it, not electronic circuitry to do the conversion.  I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 only because I haven't actually tried it overseas yet, but if it actually works like it appears it will work, it will deserve a 5+.  I'll update this review after my upcoming trip in the fall.", "The instructions and description that come with it are a bit terse and unclear, so being a technical type myself I checked it out here in the US with a continuity tester and a volt meter.  Here is what I found.  It will up and down convert from 110 V to 220 V and from 220 V to 110 V.  It does NOT do straight through 1:1 conversion, which is something the literature and markings leave in question.  There is a switch on the bottom which you set to the input voltage (the plug) at your location and it does either a 2:1 step up in voltage or a 2:1 step down depending on how the switch is set.  To check it I plugged it into a 110V US source and with the switch set to 110 and got 220 V at the output on the unit.  With the switch set to 220 (but still plugged into a 110 V source) I measured 55 V at the output indicating a 2:1 step down.  Presumably when the source is actually 220V the output will be stepped down to 110V.", "I've seen comments questioning the grounding.  I checked continuity from the ground input on the plug to the ground socket at the output and found that there is grounding continuity between the two, and it is isolated from the other connector pin and socket connections as it should be.  A continuity check between the pins and sockets connections for input and output power indicates that there is continuity between the input and output.  This would indicate that the transformer inside it may be an autotransformer (single winding with a center tap on the core), not an isolation transformer (two separate windings on the core).  There's nothing wrong with that, it's just nice to know what you actually have.", "There is an on/off power switch on the side of the unit and a fuse holder on the bottom.  The switch has a pilot light in it to indicate when the unit is on, which is a nice touch.  The instructions indicate that the unit should not be used for more that 150W in continuous use even though it's rated at 300 watts.  I'm assuming this is to prevent overheating.  There is also a warning that devices plugged into it can often \"spike\" when first turned on and momentarily draw as much as 3 times their rated steady state power.  Although it's not so stated, this is presumably an implicit warning that the current spike could blow the fuse in the unit when a device plugged into it is first turned on.  My recommendation:  Take some extra fuses and a small screwdriver with you on that trip just in case you encounter this problem.  The instructions fail to mention what fuse is required, but the markings on it indicate it's a 5GFU rated at 3 A and 250 V.", "All in all, I really like what I see so far and don't anticipate problems on the trip to Italy that I bought it for.

According to the advice to allow a 50% overhead in the rating, a 2000 W unit should have been adequate. However, I bought the 3000 W unit to have even more margin. It costs only $10 more, and is no larger in physical size (but it weighs a few pounds more) than the 2000 w unit. I inspected it closely and have used it for several days. I am very pleased with it. I have one very minor issue with the power cord that caused me to withhold the 5 star rating. See more below.", "Unlike some, ELC's description of the unit on Amazon is complete and the pictures are large and clear. I originally ordered a different transformer, but I canceled the order after I learned some of the details that were missing from its description and pictures. These missing details were provided sporadically in answers from customers and from the seller. ELC has their act together better, which enabled me to order with more confidence.", "The unit runs noiselessly, without any noticeable rise in temperature. It did have a slight odor when I unpacked it, but that disappeared once it was out of the box and had aired a bit. Keep in mind that I am using it at less than 1/2 of its rated output, and I use it only intermittently, for perhaps 10 minutes at a time. Your results may difer.", "The transformer itself is toroidal shaped, which is more efficient and reduces emission of electromagnetic field, compared to a traditional non-toroidal transformer. (It is more difficult to manufacture a toroidal transformer.)  The better efficiency contributes to the much lighter weight compared to many of the other transformers of the same rating that Amazon sells.", "Based upon electrical measurements, the unit appears to be wired as an \"auto-transformer\". The added efficiency of an auto-transformer can further contribute to a savings in weight. However, it means that the output is electrically connected to the input, not just inductively coupled through the core of the transformer. My measurements indicate that for the step-up mode in which I am operating, the neutral of the 120 V input appears to be at middle potential of the two power conductors of the 240 V output. That is not what is what is expected by foreign appliances, but is typical for a US 230 V circuit, in which both of the power conductors are not at ground potential (neither is neutral). Some have reported GFI issues using other transformers overseas, perhaps related to this feature. I am operating the unit on a GFI protected circuit and have had no issues with the GFI or my appliances. You results may vary, depending upon your appliances and house wiring.", "The unit appears to have a reasonably good quality of construction. All solder joints are covered by heat-shrink tubing, so they can't be closely inspected, but they look reasonable in size and shape of the solder joint.", "Almost all the fittings on the front and back, and the feet, are doubly secured in place by a generous applications of hot glue inside the case.", "I was drawn to this particular unit by the good ratings, and by the power cord, which appears in the picture to be, and is described as, heavy duty. It appears to be heavier than those on many of the other transformers offered by Amazon. Now that I have it in hand, I see that it is a 3 conductor, 14 AWG cable, which is moderately heavy. The NEC rates such cable for 15 Amps continuous service. For this transformer operating in the step-up mode, 15 A corresponds to a load of 1800 W or less. At an output of 3000 W, the current in that cable would be 25 amps or higher. (Actually, the rating is more accurately stated on the back of the unit as 3000 VA, not W, which puts the maximum current at 25 A.) That amount of current might also exceed what can be provided by a typical 120 V house circuit breaker and wiring. Even with the recommended 1.5 factor for a safety margin, the current would be more than 15 A in the step-up mode. The power cable is undersized for step-up operation.", "On the other hand, if you're operating in the step-down mode, the cable is adequate to provide more than 3000 VA.", "If you're considering using the the 5000 W (VA, really) largest unit offered by ELC, then I suggest that you first contact the seller to learn the size of its power cable. It appears in the pictures to be the same as for the 3000 w unit which would make it further underrated for the set-up mode, and marginal for the step-down mode.", "I am using my 3000 w unit at 1300 W, which would correspond to a current of 11 to 12 A, so the cable rating is not an issue to me. However, I have withheld the 5 star rating because I feel the supplier should either provide a heavier cable with the unit, or provide a warning about using it for continuous loads above 15 A.", "In summary, the ELC unit seems to be an excellent device. However, if you are using it at high loads without margins you may find that you have concerns related to the power cable rating or house wiring adequacy. The neutral wiring arrangement of the auto-transformer may cause difficulties in some unusual situations.", "Engineer here.  I really like this for a couple of reasons.  The packaging is good.  Arrived safely with no damage despite the weight.  It's a good size for anywhere that uses the 13 amp UK fused type of plug because you're not going to get much more than 3,000 watts out of one of those anyway.  The construction is solid and it has a nice fit / finish to it.", "It comes with a US style plug which is not ideal for my situation.  We're in the UAE and I need to step down to 120 VAC.  I didn't want to use an adapter to plug this into the wall, but I was able to find the local style plug with screw terminals for like 7 AED ($2) at a local supermarket.  Lop the USA style plug off and slap that bad boy on and you are good to go.", "It makes ZERO noise and you still have a universal 220V outlet that out can plug anything with a switching power supply into.", "EDIT: I had to knock off two star's on this one.  I've had two of these units where the 120V outlet on the front failed.  It looks like the contacts get hot and work their way out the back of the socket and then it no longer makes contact.  My wife uses them for her hair dryer so I expect that's a factor.  But still, the hairdryer is less than the rated load.", "The good news is, it's not too difficult to repair.  I fixed one using the cut off end of an extension cord, some hot glue, and wire nuts.  The other one I upgraded using a cooper wiring dual 120V outlet + 2 USB charging ports.  Used a dremel to cut the profile out of the sheet metal.  It's a snug fit, but a really nice upgrade.", "I own several vintage espresso machines that require 220v lines. Okay, I collect them.

The transformer was what I expected, but its smell surpassed what I expected. All of these transformers will emit some type of smell for a period owing to the materials employed.", "I took the transformer outside and opened the case to allow it to air out for a few days, hopefully to let most of the smell dissipate. Inside I discovered a ground wire from the transformer that had part of its sheath exposed. When I moved the wire, it came loose from its connection. I fixed it but realized that the smell was not going away quickly enough. The seller's response to a photo and text query was to return it to Amazon. I hoped for a bit more concern, but that is how things go nowadays.", "I wanted to avoid getting another typical transformer and stumbled across the ELC T-3000. What attracts me is the toroidal transformer. As noted elsewhere, toroidal transformers emit less of an inductive field, but more important, they take a little more effort to manufacture. Perhaps that would equal a slightly higher quality product.", "This transformer surpasses all the others I have owned. The case is two-thirds the height of my 1500w one and weighs perhaps two-thirds less despite handling twice the wattage. My 1500w transformer is quiet, but the T-3000 is nearly silent. The T-3000 emits some smell, but it is a fraction of what the other transformers produce.", "The T-3000 has the same two outlets on the front as any similar transformer. The circuit breaker is on the back rather than the front on my other transformer, something that I am beginning to like aesthetically. It fits into the kitchen decor less badly. The main power cable is by far the thickest of any transformer I have used. I do not think it is necessary, but I like the attempt at quality.", "There are no documents, but once you see the back things become clear. Use the red switch to choose input voltage and that is all. There are what I assume are reset buttons on the back, but they are overkill if there is already a circuit breaker. Nice safety feature.", "I was surprised that the T-3000 cost significantly less than the old-style transformer it replaced.

According to the advice to allow a 50% overhead in the rating, a 2000 W unit should have been adequate. However, I bought the 3000 W unit to have even more margin. It costs only $10 more, and is no larger in physical size (but it weighs a few pounds more) than the 2000 w unit. I inspected it closely and have used it for several days. I am very pleased with it. I have one very minor issue with the power cord that caused me to withhold the 5 star rating. See more below.", "Unlike some, ELC's description of the unit on Amazon is complete and the pictures are large and clear. I originally ordered a different transformer, but I canceled the order after I learned some of the details that were missing from its description and pictures. These missing details were provided sporadically in answers from customers and from the seller. ELC has their act together better, which enabled me to order with more confidence.", "The unit runs noiselessly, without any noticeable rise in temperature. It did have a slight odor when I unpacked it, but that disappeared once it was out of the box and had aired a bit. Keep in mind that I am using it at less than 1/2 of its rated output, and I use it only intermittently, for perhaps 10 minutes at a time. Your results may difer.", "The transformer itself is toroidal shaped, which is more efficient and reduces emission of electromagnetic field, compared to a traditional non-toroidal transformer. (It is more difficult to manufacture a toroidal transformer.)  The better efficiency contributes to the much lighter weight compared to many of the other transformers of the same rating that Amazon sells.", "Based upon electrical measurements, the unit appears to be wired as an \"auto-transformer\". The added efficiency of an auto-transformer can further contribute to a savings in weight. However, it means that the output is electrically connected to the input, not just inductively coupled through the core of the transformer. My measurements indicate that for the step-up mode in which I am operating, the neutral of the 120 V input appears to be at middle potential of the two power conductors of the 240 V output. That is not what is what is expected by foreign appliances, but is typical for a US 230 V circuit, in which both of the power conductors are not at ground potential (neither is neutral). Some have reported GFI issues using other transformers overseas, perhaps related to this feature. I am operating the unit on a GFI protected circuit and have had no issues with the GFI or my appliances. You results may vary, depending upon your appliances and house wiring.", "The unit appears to have a reasonably good quality of construction. All solder joints are covered by heat-shrink tubing, so they can't be closely inspected, but they look reasonable in size and shape of the solder joint.", "Almost all the fittings on the front and back, and the feet, are doubly secured in place by a generous applications of hot glue inside the case.", "I was drawn to this particular unit by the good ratings, and by the power cord, which appears in the picture to be, and is described as, heavy duty. It appears to be heavier than those on many of the other transformers offered by Amazon. Now that I have it in hand, I see that it is a 3 conductor, 14 AWG cable, which is moderately heavy. The NEC rates such cable for 15 Amps continuous service. For this transformer operating in the step-up mode, 15 A corresponds to a load of 1800 W or less. At an output of 3000 W, the current in that cable would be 25 amps or higher. (Actually, the rating is more accurately stated on the back of the unit as 3000 VA, not W, which puts the maximum current at 25 A.) That amount of current might also exceed what can be provided by a typical 120 V house circuit breaker and wiring. Even with the recommended 1.5 factor for a safety margin, the current would be more than 15 A in the step-up mode. The power cable is undersized for step-up operation.", "On the other hand, if you're operating in the step-down mode, the cable is adequate to provide more than 3000 VA.", "If you're considering using the the 5000 W (VA, really) largest unit offered by ELC, then I suggest that you first contact the seller to learn the size of its power cable. It appears in the pictures to be the same as for the 3000 w unit which would make it further underrated for the set-up mode, and marginal for the step-down mode.", "I am using my 3000 w unit at 1300 W, which would correspond to a current of 11 to 12 A, so the cable rating is not an issue to me. However, I have withheld the 5 star rating because I feel the supplier should either provide a heavier cable with the unit, or provide a warning about using it for continuous loads above 15 A.", "In summary, the ELC unit seems to be an excellent device. However, if you are using it at high loads without margins you may find that you have concerns related to the power cable rating or house wiring adequacy. The neutral wiring arrangement of the auto-transformer may cause difficulties in some unusual situations.", "Engineer here.  I really like this for a couple of reasons.  The packaging is good.  Arrived safely with no damage despite the weight.  It's a good size for anywhere that uses the 13 amp UK fused type of plug because you're not going to get much more than 3,000 watts out of one of those anyway.  The construction is solid and it has a nice fit / finish to it.", "It comes with a US style plug which is not ideal for my situation.  We're in the UAE and I need to step down to 120 VAC.  I didn't want to use an adapter to plug this into the wall, but I was able to find the local style plug with screw terminals for like 7 AED ($2) at a local supermarket.  Lop the USA style plug off and slap that bad boy on and you are good to go.", "It makes ZERO noise and you still have a universal 220V outlet that out can plug anything with a switching power supply into.", "EDIT: I had to knock off two star's on this one.  I've had two of these units where the 120V outlet on the front failed.  It looks like the contacts get hot and work their way out the back of the socket and then it no longer makes contact.  My wife uses them for her hair dryer so I expect that's a factor.  But still, the hairdryer is less than the rated load.", "The good news is, it's not too difficult to repair.  I fixed one using the cut off end of an extension cord, some hot glue, and wire nuts.  The other one I upgraded using a cooper wiring dual 120V outlet + 2 USB charging ports.  Used a dremel to cut the profile out of the sheet metal.  It's a snug fit, but a really nice upgrade.", "I own several vintage espresso machines that require 220v lines. Okay, I collect them. I owned a typical 1500w step-up converter for many years but recently brought back an espresso machine from Ye Olde Countree that draws just about 1500w, so I bought another typical transformer 3000w step-up converter. Most of these things are built in China at low cost, and I suspect many are from the same manufacturer with different names on the cases.", "I bought one with a USB power point on the front based on the premise that it might be newer than some of the others. The transformer was what I expected, but its smell surpassed what I expected. All of these transformers will emit some type of smell for a period owing to the materials employed.", "I took the transformer outside and opened the case to allow it to air out for a few days, hopefully to let most of the smell dissipate. Inside I discovered a ground wire from the transformer that had part of its sheath exposed. When I moved the wire, it came loose from its connection. I fixed it but realized that the smell was not going away quickly enough. The seller's response to a photo and text query was to return it to Amazon. I hoped for a bit more concern, but that is how things go nowadays.", "I wanted to avoid getting another typical transformer and stumbled across the ELC T-3000. What attracts me is the toroidal transformer. As noted elsewhere, toroidal transformers emit less of an inductive field, but more important, they take a little more effort to manufacture.

They quickly responded to address my disappointment and, without hesitation, sent me a replacement unit, free of charge.  In my experience, every product has it's lemons.

Yes, there is a fan in the unit. You can hear it, but it is not intrusive. I had the unit on the table in a conference room during a meeting and it was not noticeable to anyone at the meeting.

I loved having the diversity of being able to directly plug in my devices via traditional power plug or usb.  While many of the devices that I used this device to charge/power likely didn't need the converter (given that many had this function built in or handled via their power bricks), it was still great peace of mind to have to not have to worry about anything I was needing to plug in.

DOACE customer service promptly contacted me, providing a code in order to purchase a new unit at their expense. (We communicated back and forth several times through this process and they were always polite, friendly, and helpful.) When I received and tested it, the USB ports worked perfectly. This prompted me to retest the original one. When those USB ports also worked, I then pulled out the other brand unit and tested it. This is when I realized my mistake. I immediately wrote to DOACE customer service, explaining my mistake, apologizing, and asking how I could repay them for the free unit. I also deleted my poor review. They promptly wrote back, telling me just to keep it but asking if I would please write a new review, explaining that reviews are very important to them and that they have a lot of trouble with malicious, inaccurate reviews written by people that have never even contacted them at all. This must be a common problem and really frustrating to sellers across Amazon (and elsewhere).

I must say that the explanatory product photos on the Amazon product page are very well done, and answer very well which kinds of devices need voltage conversion and which don't. Much to my surprise, most of the typical chargeable devices like laptops, electric shavers, toothbrushes, tablets, phones, etc, don't need voltage conversion, and can just charge off the USB ports or with the two blank white adapter outlets on this box. For the remaining few items that need conversion to American voltage, the outlet that is helpfully labeled with the American flag will always supply American voltage in any country. So this outlet alone converts voltage. The blank outlets will match the voltage supplied by whichever country you're in.

This machine can converts the electricity from 220 down to 110 making it safe to charge/use a US device such as 120V hair dryer. An adapter only allows you to plug the device into the outlet and does not reduce voltage. If your device doesn't have the ability to convert the power internally then it will be ruined.", "Most similar devices are only converters, meaning that they pass along the full 220v and allow your device to step the voltage down to 110v.

Since the number of USB charged devices in our household has multiplied over the years, this alone makes the DOACE a great asset.", "Secondly, when you do need to travel, this single device should accommodate most of your equipment. I must say that the explanatory product photos on the Amazon product page are very well done, and answer very well which kinds of devices need voltage conversion and which don't. Much to my surprise, most of the typical chargeable devices like laptops, electric shavers, toothbrushes, tablets, phones, etc, don't need voltage conversion, and can just charge off the USB ports or with the two blank white adapter outlets on this box. For the remaining few items that need conversion to American voltage, the outlet that is helpfully labeled with the American flag will always supply American voltage in any country. So this outlet alone converts voltage. The blank outlets will match the voltage supplied by whichever country you're in. Blow dryers, electric kettles, and other items requiring the American voltage should be plugged into the flag outlet.", "Finally it has several different plug adapters. Great peace of mind for when you are traveling, that you should be able to use all of your electronics safely and reliably.\"", "Converter worked very well with my hair dryer in EUROPE. The handy carry bag was great as it allowed me to put USB and other cords into it as well as the DOACE itself. Better than a plain adapter charger! This machine can converts the electricity from 220 down to 110 making it safe to charge/use a US device such as 120V hair dryer. An adapter only allows you to plug the device into the outlet and does not reduce voltage. If your device doesn't have the ability to convert the power internally then it will be ruined.", "Most similar devices are only converters, meaning that they pass along the full 220v and allow your device to step the voltage down to 110v. The good news is that most modern AC adaptors can do that. Make sure that's the case or you can destroy your device. For example, my iPhone will automatically step the voltage down, but some devices will not.", "If you use the right outlet (important), this device can step down the voltage, but the step down is only suitable for simple devices like irons, steamers, or the like. Not for most digital devices.", "It's relatively small and only weights about a pound, so that's all good. Plenty of adapters too which should cover you in most countries.", "I love America but I think the huge American flag on this device is overkill. It's not made in the USA, and I really don't need to fly my flag in the face of others while abroad.

I plug in my USA 120VAC electric kettle and it works fine, like being back home.  The side of the unit got a little warm.  I used it everyday.  The adapter portion also works great where I plug in my 2 different camera battery chargers (120-220 vac).  Lastly the 4 USB ports all work at 220vac and 120vac back home.  I use the USB ports to charge our cell phone and fitbit watch.  It also comes with a nice travel case, 3 physical adapters for global use and a 4 foot heavy duty  & removable AC cable.

The 3 outlets and 4 USB charging ports were more than enough for myself. The blue LED is a great indicator and the fans are a lot quieter than I expected. The travel case makes carrying this a breeze. It was a great buy and I would recommend my friends who are planning to travel to take one as well.", "It worked well for the first 6 or so hours. Then it let the smoke out! I tried to capture all the smoke and put it back in, but must have missed some. In all seriousness, this was my first time to Europe. So I bought this converter due to the fact that I wasn't sure what kind of line power / adapters that I would be dealing with in Barcelona, Spain. On the first night I was using it to charge my phone. All I had plugged into this was my actual phone charger because the 4 usb will only put out enough power to \"Slowly charge\" I think it is .5 amps for slow charging. To overcome this I had my Pixel's charger plugged into the device and only my Pixel charger. I  was using my phone in bed when I heard a snapping sound, and saw a pretty blue flash to the left of my head eventually followed by the smell of an electrical short. Thank God that I was awake to hear the short and unplug the device. I don't think it would have went any further than the initial spark due to fact that the device immediately died and the blue status light went out . The device of course shorted out, but luckily it didn't short out my phone. As a happenstance, I also purchased: \"Ceptics CT-9C USA to Most of Europe Travel Adapter Plug - Type C (3 Pack)\" for my wife's hair dryer and iron (because they are over 200W). So at least I wasn't trapped in without any adapter conversion. They do not do any 220 to 110 conversion, but they had all 110v outlets in my hotel. Anyways, my phone charger is also auto sensing / converting from 220 to 110 in the event that they only had 220v outlets. I am returning and not replacing this device. I will keep and use the Ceptics converters in the event that I ever go to Europe again.", "The convert worked well for one day but quickly exploded with a loud bang. I was charging two phones (well under the 200W limit), one through the AC plugs and the other through the USB. When I unplugged both devices, there was a loud bang. I thought something had fallen off a shelf. I looked around and noticed a burning smell and quickly unplugged everything. I lifted up the converted and could smell a distinctive burned smell coming from the vents. I plugged only the converter back into the wall and nothing. I checked the outlet with a lamp and the outlet worked fine. Luckily, all of the electronics plugged into the convert were undamaged. I do not know if my unit was defective, but I would highly advise against buying this product.", "Edit: When I got back from my trip I opened up the converter.

It ALSO has a step-down converter, which works on things like blow dryers, flat irons, etc.  Things like my iPhone and Kindle, I did NOT need to switch the 'converter' switch, because the iPhone and Kindle already have an internal converter, so all I needed to use was the adapter. I do have to comment, however, that it seemed that my flat iron ran a bit hot so I just used a lower setting and turned it off if I felt that it was perhaps getting to hot, and could still use it because of the heat retained. It did NOT fry it, though, and is still working just fine.

Traveled to many countries with this power converter\uff0c it is a sturdy product-the previous one I bought has been used for almost a year with high frequency and this new one already used for two weeks, both works flawlessly.  Verified usage in China, India, and several countries of Europe such as Italy,Ireland and Russia. The new hair straightener compatibility helps a lot for my friend who has an expensive hair straightener. And she is very happy about it\uff01It also works great on toothbrush and charging the iPad.  Never been happier during my 10 years online shopping experience. I already bought several more for my colleagues. Will keep following Sokoo\u2026the one stop solution for travel voltage issue.", "Great product. We did lots of researches before finally purchasing this updated version of SOKOO voltage converter, for several reasons:", "First of all, it clearly declared itself as a new version which is compatible with digital devices such as hair straightener, curling Iron and electrical toothbrush, which is an obvious improvement in technology of this field. I have heard some friends using hair curling Iron and burnt their hair without the proper voltage converter during a travel.", "Secondly, it could charge 4 mobile devices simultaneously, which is pretty handy functionality when traveling with many friends, family or colleagues. Considering everybody has some devices need charging,be it smart phone, ipad, or bluetooth earbuds... it is really practical design.", "Thirdly, this product is really quiet and low temperature at night, I used it continuously for 2 days and nights but cannot hear any noise from the fan. I think it is because the smart fan didn\u2019t turn itself on during normal operating temperatures less than 100\u00b0F. Even if I plug several devices onto it and charge/use them at the same time, the machine\u2019s temperature didn\u2019t rise obviously. After that, there are 4 adapters included which is quite helpful for traveling to different countries. You don\u2019t need to buy any other adapters in future because over 150 countries are covered by these 5 plugs.", "Last but not least, this machine give me total feeling of secure. For people who have regular traveling experiences, safety is always the first priority, nobody wants to find his laptop/ipad dead in Africa safari because of over-voltage, or his expensive high-resolution camera broken because of over-current, or mess up their hair by hair straightener /curler iron in another country before some important meeting.", "Some people might don\u2019t understand the real purpose of voltage converter-it is actually designed to give people safe of mind, by transferring voltage from 240V to 110V, it make you feel like using your appliances in USA during your travel to other countries. It is always a good investment to spend about $40 dollars to protect your multiple devices worth over several hundred dollars, even some of these devices boasted to have the so-called adaptive voltage scaling ability, I don't\u2019 want to risk my time and money to plug my $500 camera barely into a 240V socket.", "To conclude, try this really nice product, get ready for your next travel with 100% secure experience.", "Better than my expectation.", "Excellent streamlined design. Finally got a voltage converter that has real compatibility for wife's curling iron. The blue USB port charges the Mobile phone as fast. Good job Sokoo\uff01Updated version should be recommended to everybody.", "Just got back from Spain. I brought 2 converters/adapters: Sokoo and Croztek.", "The Sokoo worked with both of my Babyliss curling wand and flat iron. My Babyliss travel hair dryer was worked with Sokoo but was very weak.", "The Croztek 2300W worked excellent with my hair dryer but did NOT work with my curling wand or flatner.", "The hotels we stayed at did provide a hair dryer so in the end, I only used the Sokoo for my curling wand and straightner. Was able to charge my Husband\u2019s Apple Macbook (15in), apple watch, 2 apple iphones with no issues.", "In the past we have travelled with those big clunky converters that come with only one type of plug.  These converters are so heavy they would inevitably fall out of the wall socket once you plugged something into them. No so with the Sokoo Power Converter.  It has it own cord (3ft) and comes with many socket adapters.  We like that is has 2 sockets which is very handy in the bathroom when you travel with electric toothbrushes and other such things.  Also the 4 USB sockets mean everything can be charged in one place and not scattered around the room where you are staying making it less likely you will leave something behind!  All in all a vast improvement on previous designs.", "Travelled abroad several days last week with this voltage converter , it helps us survived the 240 volt  electrical output there. The best feature is hair straightener compatibility as well as plugging several devices and charge them all at once. The compact design didn't take much room in my suitcase, love the minimalism appearance which is fashionable and provides multi-levels of protection to my iphone X.  Highly Recommended~", "I needed a voltage converter for the trip I'm currently on in Italy. Similar to the experience of another reviewer, this did NOT convert the voltage for my [120 V] hair straightener. The instructions say not use with with hair appliances greater than 200 V. Alas, figuring this would be safe to use with my straightener, I plugged the \"converter\" into a 220 V socket, turned it on (yes, I made sure the green light was on), and plugged in my hair straightener. The straightener definitely turned on, but only for about 3 seconds before it died. My husband and I, however, continued to use this product to charge our dual-voltage electronics; note that during use, the internal fan would turn on and off periodically and was very loud.

It makes no perceptible sound or smell unless you are right up against it, but it is very slight, and I don't feel it is any worse than other appliances emit.  You can certainly minimize these potential annoyances by switching off the breaker on the back of the unit when it is not in use.", "I would not hesitate to recommend this unit.", "I had to test a 220V-only server before signing off on delivery, and the location where it was delivered had only 110V power.  This thing saved my bacon.  With the right power cords you can get two separate 220V taps out of it (nice because at 220V even something as simple as a power strip is crazy expensive) and I probably pulled at least 1,000W through it.  I wouldn't go much above that; you should always leave a lot of headroom between the device rating and the actual usage.", "This is my forth step up/down voltage converters i have bought from Amazon. the previous one are other brand. I have to say this is an excellent product! it is silence with well made casing. No smell. What made me bought this product was its detachable power code which make it easy to use on different type of sockets without needing one adapter. i would say i'm happy with this purchase.", "I bought this as a replacement to a unit that died after 7 years of service.  I use this particular unit to operate Italian appliances in the US, and it has exceeded my expectations.  The feature I like best is the startup is almost immediate, unlike the unit I used previously.  No more than 1-2 seconds and it's good to go.  It's also quiet and fits into a small space.  Nice unit.", "Appears heavy duty.  Easy to use.  It's so cool that it converts 110V up to 220 volt.  I have had a bidet seat that was mistakenly shipped to me in the European voltage.

If you plug it in to a 120v outlet, you get 120v at the output. If you plug it in to a 240v outlet, you get 240v at the output. Many US electronics allow for that. For instance, if you plug the AC adapter for a US MacBook Pro or an iPhone into a 240v source, it will be fine. On the other hand, your razor or hair dryer will likely immediately burn itself out.", "OK, back to the review: this is a well constructed adapter that will plug into US, European, Australian, or UK outlets. You can then utilize the four USB ports, two of which are smart ports and all of which provide at least 2.1 Amps. The two smart ports are dependent upon the USB device, feeding out the current based upon feedback from the device; some USB devices have the ability to request a specific current, but in part this depends upon the inner workings of the power adapter so your mileage may vary here. In any case, all four USB ports can be used at once, and I had no problem charging two iPads and two iPhones simultaneously, all with good charging speed comparable to what I'd get with an iPad charger (the larger one, not the little cube that comes with the iPhone). You can also plug in an AC cord simultaneously, so while charging my four USB devices, I was able to plug in my MacBook and had no problems there either.", "Note that the AC for US plugs does not include a grounding prong, and the outlet built into the adaptor does not incorporate a grounding receptacle so three prong US AC plugs cannot be used without a separate adapter. The entire unit can handle 660w at 110v, so the vast majority of devices you're probably carrying internationally will work without difficulty.

The entire unit comes with a small zipped carrying case.", "Overall, this is much easier to use than the collection of adapters that I typically carry with me internationally, with the major advantage of allowing me to leave my pile of USB chargers home as well.

A quick read of the one-sheet of directions before leaving the country is advisable as use isn't necessarily intuitive.", "Before leaving for a 10-day trip to Italy, I had only given the adapter a test run using U.S. power plugs. It worked great. The sliding mechanism for switching between modes is very clever and easy to use. Just got back from vacation and am happy to report I am very pleased with the adapter's performance. No matter where I was, from Florence to Liguria to Lake Garda to Rome, whether I was staying in an older flat or a newer hotel, the SublimeWare adapter worked like a champ and never overheated. The four ports were extremely convenient. I was traveling with a companion and we each had phones and other items to charge at the end of every day. We never encountered any problems. I also noticed that, compared to adapters I've used in the past, it didn't sag when plugged into the wall, regardless of how many items were connected.

The concern was that the desk would not be steady when raised to max height.

Without the keyboard tray, this stand isn't really that deep, but as soon as you add it it juts out an additional 12 inches or so due to the fact that its not actually positioned UNDER the desk, but rather begins right where the desk ends.

According to the advice to allow a 50% overhead in the rating, a 2000 W unit should have been adequate. However, I bought the 3000 W unit to have even more margin. It costs only $10 more, and is no larger in physical size (but it weighs a few pounds more) than the 2000 w unit. I inspected it closely and have used it for several days. I am very pleased with it.

The added efficiency of an auto-transformer can further contribute to a savings in weight. However, it means that the output is electrically connected to the input, not just inductively coupled through the core of the transformer. My measurements indicate that for the step-up mode in which I am operating, the neutral of the 120 V input appears to be at middle potential of the two power conductors of the 240 V output. That is not what is what is expected by foreign appliances, but is typical for a US 230 V circuit, in which both of the power conductors are not at ground potential (neither is neutral). Some have reported GFI issues using other transformers overseas, perhaps related to this feature. I am operating the unit on a GFI protected circuit and have had no issues with the GFI or my appliances. You results may vary, depending upon your appliances and house wiring.", "The unit appears to have a reasonably good quality of construction. All solder joints are covered by heat-shrink tubing, so they can't be closely inspected, but they look reasonable in size and shape of the solder joint.", "Almost all the fittings on the front and back, and the feet, are doubly secured in place by a generous applications of hot glue inside the case.", "I was drawn to this particular unit by the good ratings, and by the power cord, which appears in the picture to be, and is described as, heavy duty. It appears to be heavier than those on many of the other transformers offered by Amazon. Now that I have it in hand, I see that it is a 3 conductor, 14 AWG cable, which is moderately heavy. The NEC rates such cable for 15 Amps continuous service. For this transformer operating in the step-up mode, 15 A corresponds to a load of 1800 W or less. At an output of 3000 W, the current in that cable would be 25 amps or higher. (Actually, the rating is more accurately stated on the back of the unit as 3000 VA, not W, which puts the maximum current at 25 A.) That amount of current might also exceed what can be provided by a typical 120 V house circuit breaker and wiring. Even with the recommended 1.5 factor for a safety margin, the current would be more than 15 A in the step-up mode. The power cable is undersized for step-up operation.", "On the other hand, if you're operating in the step-down mode, the cable is adequate to provide more than 3000 VA.", "If you're considering using the the 5000 W (VA, really) largest unit offered by ELC, then I suggest that you first contact the seller to learn the size of its power cable. It appears in the pictures to be the same as for the 3000 w unit which would make it further underrated for the set-up mode, and marginal for the step-down mode.", "I am using my 3000 w unit at 1300 W, which would correspond to a current of 11 to 12 A, so the cable rating is not an issue to me. However, I have withheld the 5 star rating because I feel the supplier should either provide a heavier cable with the unit, or provide a warning about using it for continuous loads above 15 A.", "In summary, the ELC unit seems to be an excellent device. However, if you are using it at high loads without margins you may find that you have concerns related to the power cable rating or house wiring adequacy. The neutral wiring arrangement of the auto-transformer may cause difficulties in some unusual situations.", "Engineer here.  I really like this for a couple of reasons.  The packaging is good.  Arrived safely with no damage despite the weight.  It's a good size for anywhere that uses the 13 amp UK fused type of plug because you're not going to get much more than 3,000 watts out of one of those anyway.  The construction is solid and it has a nice fit / finish to it.", "It comes with a US style plug which is not ideal for my situation.  We're in the UAE and I need to step down to 120 VAC.  I didn't want to use an adapter to plug this into the wall, but I was able to find the local style plug with screw terminals for like 7 AED ($2) at a local supermarket.  Lop the USA style plug off and slap that bad boy on and you are good to go.", "It makes ZERO noise and you still have a universal 220V outlet that out can plug anything with a switching power supply into.", "EDIT: I had to knock off two star's on this one.  I've had two of these units where the 120V outlet on the front failed.  It looks like the contacts get hot and work their way out the back of the socket and then it no longer makes contact.  My wife uses them for her hair dryer so I expect that's a factor.  But still, the hairdryer is less than the rated load.", "The good news is, it's not too difficult to repair.  I fixed one using the cut off end of an extension cord, some hot glue, and wire nuts.  The other one I upgraded using a cooper wiring dual 120V outlet + 2 USB charging ports.  Used a dremel to cut the profile out of the sheet metal.  It's a snug fit, but a really nice upgrade.", "I own several vintage espresso machines that require 220v lines. Okay, I collect them. I owned a typical 1500w step-up converter for many years but recently brought back an espresso machine from Ye Olde Countree that draws just about 1500w, so I bought another typical transformer 3000w step-up converter. Most of these things are built in China at low cost, and I suspect many are from the same manufacturer with different names on the cases.", "I bought one with a USB power point on the front based on the premise that it might be newer than some of the others. The transformer was what I expected, but its smell surpassed what I expected. All of these transformers will emit some type of smell for a period owing to the materials employed.", "I took the transformer outside and opened the case to allow it to air out for a few days, hopefully to let most of the smell dissipate. Inside I discovered a ground wire from the transformer that had part of its sheath exposed. When I moved the wire, it came loose from its connection. I fixed it but realized that the smell was not going away quickly enough. The seller's response to a photo and text query was to return it to Amazon. I hoped for a bit more concern, but that is how things go nowadays.", "I wanted to avoid getting another typical transformer and stumbled across the ELC T-3000. What attracts me is the toroidal transformer. As noted elsewhere, toroidal transformers emit less of an inductive field, but more important, they take a little more effort to manufacture. Perhaps that would equal a slightly higher quality product.", "This transformer surpasses all the others I have owned. The case is two-thirds the height of my 1500w one and weighs perhaps two-thirds less despite handling twice the wattage. My 1500w transformer is quiet, but the T-3000 is nearly silent. The T-3000 emits some smell, but it is a fraction of what the other transformers produce.", "The T-3000 has the same two outlets on the front as any similar transformer. The circuit breaker is on the back rather than the front on my other transformer, something that I am beginning to like aesthetically. It fits into the kitchen decor less badly. The main power cable is by far the thickest of any transformer I have used. I do not think it is necessary, but I like the attempt at quality.", "There are no documents, but once you see the back things become clear. Use the red switch to choose input voltage and that is all. There are what I assume are reset buttons on the back, but they are overkill if there is already a circuit breaker. Nice safety feature.", "I was surprised that the T-3000 cost significantly less than the old-style transformer it replaced. That was a pleasant surprise, especially considering the T-3000 is better made. Bombay Electronics was absolutely tops to deal with, too. Excellent communication, packaging, and rapid shipment.", "Treat these step-up/step-down transformers with due care.

I bought several of these and I actually use one as an everyday step-down converter for a TV and home theater I bought from USA where the voltage and my products are rated at 110-120V (in my country the national grid is 240V). There is a small switch which you set to your mains voltage - [An aside here: the values on this switch are 115V and 230V, but almost all appliances will work fine within a certain range, ie 110-120V and 220 to 240V]. The converter upconverts the incoming 110-120V to 220-240V output, or downconverts 220-240V to 110-120V by doing a simple 2-to-1 or 1-to-2. There is no conversion for the current (amps), only for the voltage.", "I sometimes hear a low buzzing noise from the converter when it has been running for several hours. I initially thought it was that particular unit, so i switched it, but the new one also had the same issue. But anyway even after a few months of this there doesn't seem to be any bad effects from the buzzing noise, and there's no overheating at all, so it's still 5 stars. And that acts as an alert that I've been watching TV too long! Some have complained that they received busted units, but all the 3 500W units I ordered in Oct.2014 were perfectly fine and intact.", "Others have said, and Litefuze themselves also advise this, but it bears repeating. If you plan on using it for more than an hour or so at a time, buy a converter that's at least double the wattage of the combined gadgets you'll be connecting to the converter. So in my case the stuff I'm connecting to the converter are: a TV rated at 142W, a Vizio soundbar rated about 10W, and my home theater at 12W. The math comes to 142+10+12=164W, so I needed one that's at least 164 x 2 = 328W. The closest to this is the 500W converter- it doesn't hurt to have the extra capacity.", "A few niggles:", "- I dont like the buzzing sound after several hours of use, but it's not loud and doesnt seem to have any more ill effects.", "- More serious, I wish the small switch to change the voltage was better hidden or more difficult to access. I have it set to '230V', so it converts my 240V to 120V. But if a bumbling someone were to accidentally change it to the '115V' setting (which is easy to do with the easily accessible switch), then I think what would happen is the 1-to-2 upconversion. So my actual 240V would be output as 480V, frying my electronics almost instantly! [Again, this is just my opinion based on my understanding of how the thing works and I'm no electrician. If this is wrong someone please comment on this post and correct me - I'll alter it immediately].", "- The unit itself is quite heavy, about 300-500grams (half a kg). So take that into consideration if you are planning to use it for travel. I dont, so the weight isn't an issue for me.", "Overall though, these negatives are still minor enough for it to earn a full 5 stars. Excellent product!", "This is a well made 150 W transformer, and it's priced fairly.  I plan to power a device that requires 230 VAC and uses just 120 W of power, so I believe I'll be quite happy with it.", "As you can see in the listing, LiteFuze calls this a \"300 W\" transformer.  I don't see how US regulations allow the company to do this, because as LiteFuze says in the supplied instruction leaflet, the unit will only provide 150 W continuously.", "I'm an electrical engineer and I work for an electric utility, so I'm familiar with transformer nameplate ratings for various types of transformers, including distribution transformers and substation transformers.  Every transformer that an electric utility buys has a power rating on its nameplate, and that value is always the CONTINUOUS power rating of the transformer.", "The manufacturer should say that this transformer has a power rating of 150 W; not \"300 W\".", "After trying and returning other voltage CONVERTERS, I bought this one because it is an actual TRANSFORMER.  For travel it is a bit heavy and large compared to the others but still not bad.  That's probably because it has an actual transformer inside it, not electronic circuitry to do the conversion.  I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 only because I haven't actually tried it overseas yet, but if it actually works like it appears it will work, it will deserve a 5+.  I'll update this review after my upcoming trip in the fall.", "The instructions and description that come with it are a bit terse and unclear, so being a technical type myself I checked it out here in the US with a continuity tester and a volt meter.  Here is what I found.  It will up and down convert from 110 V to 220 V and from 220 V to 110 V.  It does NOT do straight through 1:1 conversion, which is something the literature and markings leave in question.  There is a switch on the bottom which you set to the input voltage (the plug) at your location and it does either a 2:1 step up in voltage or a 2:1 step down depending on how the switch is set.  To check it I plugged it into a 110V US source and with the switch set to 110 and got 220 V at the output on the unit.  With the switch set to 220 (but still plugged into a 110 V source) I measured 55 V at the output indicating a 2:1 step down.  Presumably when the source is actually 220V the output will be stepped down to 110V.", "I've seen comments questioning the grounding.  I checked continuity from the ground input on the plug to the ground socket at the output and found that there is grounding continuity between the two, and it is isolated from the other connector pin and socket connections as it should be.  A continuity check between the pins and sockets connections for input and output power indicates that there is continuity between the input and output.  This would indicate that the transformer inside it may be an autotransformer (single winding with a center tap on the core), not an isolation transformer (two separate windings on the core).  There's nothing wrong with that, it's just nice to know what you actually have.", "There is an on/off power switch on the side of the unit and a fuse holder on the bottom.  The switch has a pilot light in it to indicate when the unit is on, which is a nice touch.  The instructions indicate that the unit should not be used for more that 150W in continuous use even though it's rated at 300 watts.  I'm assuming this is to prevent overheating.  There is also a warning that devices plugged into it can often \"spike\" when first turned on and momentarily draw as much as 3 times their rated steady state power.  Although it's not so stated, this is presumably an implicit warning that the current spike could blow the fuse in the unit when a device plugged into it is first turned on.  My recommendation:  Take some extra fuses and a small screwdriver with you on that trip just in case you encounter this problem.  The instructions fail to mention what fuse is required, but the markings on it indicate it's a 5GFU rated at 3 A and 250 V.", "All in all, I really like what I see so far and don't anticipate problems on the trip to Italy that I bought it for.  It appears to be a well made, quality product.", "Bought this thinking I could use my Andis razor in Dubai.", "Plugged it in and it started overheating and my razor started smoking. Both were toast after about 20 seconds. Had to buy a new razor and returned the converter. Paid $30.00 for the converter  but they only refunded $20.00.

This converter does have a small cooling fan that runs when it's plugged in. I found that cooling fan to be whisper quiet and wasn't \"noisy\" at all. It was a soft hum that wasn't disturbing what so ever. If you place this converter on the night stand by your bed you might hear it. If you place it away from your bed, you won't hear it.

Maybe I'm just too cheap or maybe it's being too stubborn but I'mturning my stupid house into a smart home.  Part of this is installing smart switches in the place of my existing stupid switches.  Smart switches, as opposed to the stupid ones, require a load, line and a neutral line with an optional ground.  Since my home was built in the 50's it's safe to say there are no neutral lines in any of my switch boxes, which is a no-brainer.  Determining line vs. load as a blind guy without this magic wand means turning off the breaker, connecting the 2 black wires and making a neutral, then turning the breaker back on.  If it works then cool, if not then it's do the whole thing all over again.  Oddly enough it turns out that every time I try I guess the wrong combination, on occasion more than once too.  So if you don't know how electricity works or if you're a blind apprentice level electrician this is a must have!  Seriously if I can just go pull all of the switches out without disconnecting and find, then label the hot wire I can kill my service disconnect breaker and replace all of my switches at one time.

But nothing could stop it - it turned back on immediately and we finished all the clothing for the day. I cannot say enough good things - it was so good I left it behind with my grandmother and ordered a second one as soon as I was home.

I bought several of these and I actually use one as an everyday step-down converter for a TV and home theater I bought from USA where the voltage and my products are rated at 110-120V (in my country the national grid is 240V). There is a small switch which you set to your mains voltage - [An aside here: the values on this switch are 115V and 230V, but almost all appliances will work fine within a certain range, ie 110-120V and 220 to 240V]. The converter upconverts the incoming 110-120V to 220-240V output, or downconverts 220-240V to 110-120V by doing a simple 2-to-1 or 1-to-2. There is no conversion for the current (amps), only for the voltage.", "I sometimes hear a low buzzing noise from the converter when it has been running for several hours. I initially thought it was that particular unit, so i switched it, but the new one also had the same issue. But anyway even after a few months of this there doesn't seem to be any bad effects from the buzzing noise, and there's no overheating at all, so it's still 5 stars. And that acts as an alert that I've been watching TV too long! Some have complained that they received busted units, but all the 3 500W units I ordered in Oct.2014 were perfectly fine and intact.", "Others have said, and Litefuze themselves also advise this, but it bears repeating. If you plan on using it for more than an hour or so at a time, buy a converter that's at least double the wattage of the combined gadgets you'll be connecting to the converter. So in my case the stuff I'm connecting to the converter are: a TV rated at 142W, a Vizio soundbar rated about 10W, and my home theater at 12W. The math comes to 142+10+12=164W, so I needed one that's at least 164 x 2 = 328W. The closest to this is the 500W converter- it doesn't hurt to have the extra capacity.", "A few niggles:", "- I dont like the buzzing sound after several hours of use, but it's not loud and doesnt seem to have any more ill effects.", "- More serious, I wish the small switch to change the voltage was better hidden or more difficult to access. I have it set to '230V', so it converts my 240V to 120V. But if a bumbling someone were to accidentally change it to the '115V' setting (which is easy to do with the easily accessible switch), then I think what would happen is the 1-to-2 upconversion. So my actual 240V would be output as 480V, frying my electronics almost instantly! [Again, this is just my opinion based on my understanding of how the thing works and I'm no electrician. If this is wrong someone please comment on this post and correct me - I'll alter it immediately].", "- The unit itself is quite heavy, about 300-500grams (half a kg). So take that into consideration if you are planning to use it for travel.

I don't see how US regulations allow the company to do this, because as LiteFuze says in the supplied instruction leaflet, the unit will only provide 150 W continuously.", "I'm an electrical engineer and I work for an electric utility, so I'm familiar with transformer nameplate ratings for various types of transformers, including distribution transformers and substation transformers.  Every transformer that an electric utility buys has a power rating on its nameplate, and that value is always the CONTINUOUS power rating of the transformer.", "The manufacturer should say that this transformer has a power rating of 150 W; not \"300 W\".", "After trying and returning other voltage CONVERTERS, I bought this one because it is an actual TRANSFORMER.  For travel it is a bit heavy and large compared to the others but still not bad.  That's probably because it has an actual transformer inside it, not electronic circuitry to do the conversion.  I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 only because I haven't actually tried it overseas yet, but if it actually works like it appears it will work, it will deserve a 5+.  I'll update this review after my upcoming trip in the fall.", "The instructions and description that come with it are a bit terse and unclear, so being a technical type myself I checked it out here in the US with a continuity tester and a volt meter.  Here is what I found.  It will up and down convert from 110 V to 220 V and from 220 V to 110 V.  It does NOT do straight through 1:1 conversion, which is something the literature and markings leave in question.  There is a switch on the bottom which you set to the input voltage (the plug) at your location and it does either a 2:1 step up in voltage or a 2:1 step down depending on how the switch is set.  To check it I plugged it into a 110V US source and with the switch set to 110 and got 220 V at the output on the unit.  With the switch set to 220 (but still plugged into a 110 V source) I measured 55 V at the output indicating a 2:1 step down.  Presumably when the source is actually 220V the output will be stepped down to 110V.", "I've seen comments questioning the grounding.  I checked continuity from the ground input on the plug to the ground socket at the output and found that there is grounding continuity between the two, and it is isolated from the other connector pin and socket connections as it should be.  A continuity check between the pins and sockets connections for input and output power indicates that there is continuity between the input and output.  This would indicate that the transformer inside it may be an autotransformer (single winding with a center tap on the core), not an isolation transformer (two separate windings on the core).  There's nothing wrong with that, it's just nice to know what you actually have.", "There is an on/off power switch on the side of the unit and a fuse holder on the bottom.  The switch has a pilot light in it to indicate when the unit is on, which is a nice touch.  The instructions indicate that the unit should not be used for more that 150W in continuous use even though it's rated at 300 watts.  I'm assuming this is to prevent overheating.  There is also a warning that devices plugged into it can often \"spike\" when first turned on and momentarily draw as much as 3 times their rated steady state power.  Although it's not so stated, this is presumably an implicit warning that the current spike could blow the fuse in the unit when a device plugged into it is first turned on.  My recommendation:  Take some extra fuses and a small screwdriver with you on that trip just in case you encounter this problem.  The instructions fail to mention what fuse is required, but the markings on it indicate it's a 5GFU rated at 3 A and 250 V.", "All in all, I really like what I see so far and don't anticipate problems on the trip to Italy that I bought it for.

These are well made and have the features of meters several times the price. The additional price for the CL800 is small and worth the extra features that I don't use often (such as K-type temp). The LED light should have been brighter and should have its own switch (it is the same switch for the back-light). The magnet attachment is great as well but is not included. The leads are the weak point of the meter. I prefer extra rugged leads and foresee replacing them a couple times a year. All that being said, I am extremely rough on tools/equipment and I think this one is going to hold up for many years.", "I deleted my old comment to say that it's a very nice meter.

I have an occasional need for a meter to test an HVAC capacitor, the continuity of a fuse, a faulty breaker or my car's alternator.  I owned a Klein MM6000 about a year ago for a very short time.  It seemed like a fine meter and worked well but I was hung up on owning a Fluke as they are known to be the best in the industry.  I tend to gravitate toward the best of the best when I buy anything as there is so much crap out there.  Since I didn't have much of a need for a meter at the time, I returned the MM6000 and started researching Fluke to determine which one I wanted to buy.  Needless to say it has been a year and I just ended up with the Klein CL800.  The main reason was price.  I paid $120 on Amazon for this meter and it's features are equivalent to Fluke's that cost $300-$500.  I would say the features contained in this meter are closest to what you would get with a Fluke 375 or 376 which are $329 and $468 respectively.  Obviously the most important thing with a meter is that it is accurate.  The specs on this meter, according to the data sheets, appear to be on par with many of the clamp meters from Fluke.", "This meter has so many great and convenient features.  First of all it is TRMS.  It tests AC/DC voltage to 1000V and AC/DC amps to 600A, and also handles millivolts.  It tests continuity, capacitance, diodes, resistance, frequency and temperature.  It has a setting for low impedance, it has a flash light, a back light, hold button, min/max, range, and a non-contact voltage tester.  The non-contact voltage tester lights a red light when there is voltage present but there is no tone and it works from approximately 6 inches from a power source such as a light switch or outlet.", "Some of the things I specifically like about this meter are the fact that it has one setting for volts and one setting for amps and you use the select button to switch between AC and DC.  This meter will also measure millivolts but there is no extra setting.  You simply set it to measure volts and it will auto range appropriately.  I also like the flashlight and the non-contact voltage tester.  Most of the Flukes don't have either of these features.", "There is nothing about this meter that I don't like.  I will mention a couple of things that changed from the previous models of the Klein clamp meters to the new ones.  The previous models included an audible non-contact voltage tester, slots in the rear of the meter for lead storage, the previous models included a bar graph which this one does not, and the included leads are of lower quality and do not come with alligator clips included.  These features would have been nice additions to this meter but are very minor in the scope of what this meter does.", "I would have to say this is a great meter for only $120.", "I bought this meter to do a proper HVAC superheat refrigerant test of my home HVAC. I compared the temperature reading on this Klein meter to 4 other thermometers I had and also the crushed ice water calibration test and found this Klein to be off by about 7F at 32F.

I trusted my gut and ordered the Beautiplove and I couldn't have been happier. It was a destination wedding at a pretty remote area of Greece, and the only way anyone could de-wrinkle their clothes after traveling was on their own. Many brought steamers - but all of them failed before the big day even arrived. They were sputtering water, overheating, or not working at all. It ended up being just this one champion of a steamer the day of the wedding, steaming the brides dress, the grooms suit, all the groomsmen's suits, all the bridesmaids dresses, the bridesmaids robes, the mother of the bride and grooms dresses...I think you get the point. This little steamer DID IT ALL - at one point, someone tripped on the cord and the steamer crashed to the floor, the top flew off, water everywhere...we were so fearful it wasn't going to work anymore. But nothing could stop it - it turned back on immediately and we finished all the clothing for the day. I cannot say enough good things - it was so good I left it behind with my grandmother and ordered a second one as soon as I was home. And at least five people from the wedding have asked me for the make/model of it too. If you are traveling abroad, don't think twice. This thing is AMAZING.", "Great for travel.
